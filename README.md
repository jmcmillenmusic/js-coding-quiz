# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description

As I continue to understand JavaScript and its capabilities, it's important that I don't forget the basics, so I created this timed JavaScript quiz in order to stay up-to-date with my JavaScript skills and remember crucial knowledge for technical/coding interviews and for my day-to-day work in the office.

Click on the Start Quiz button to begin the quiz. Per the on-screen instructions, you have 75 seconds to answer all 5 questions. You'll be able to track how many questions you've answered correctly after clicking on an answer. Wrong answers deduct 10 seconds from the clock. When the timer runs out or when you finish the quiz (whichever comes first), you see your score and can enter your initials to save your score on the leaderboard. You can take the quiz multiple times to improve your score.
